	<p>
		Generate a Rails app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. Deploy this app to Heroku (a free *.herokuapp.com URL) so we can test it out live. If you have time, add extra features to this app (be creative) and tell us what you did so we donâ€™t miss it.
